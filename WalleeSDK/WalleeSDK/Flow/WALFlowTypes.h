 @typedef WALFlowAction
 
  The @c FlowCoordinator allows the execution of certain actions on the flow. Those actions
  depends on the current state of the coordinator.
 
  This enum holds all possible actions which can be triggered from the outside. If a particular
  action can be executed depends on the inner state of the coordinator. To check if a particular
  action can be executed the FlowCoordinator#dryTriggerAction(FlowAction) can be
  invoked.
 
  To actually execute a particular action the method FlowCoordinator#triggerAction(FlowAction)
  can be used. See also the documentation of the actions to see when an execution is generally
  possible.
